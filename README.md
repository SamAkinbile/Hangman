# HANGMAN: Game of thinking

![Hangman](images/hangmanimage.jpeg)


### What is Hangman game?
Hangman is a word-guessing game that is often played between two people. One person thinks of a word and draws a blank line for each letter in the word. The other person tries to guess the word by suggesting letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure (representing a "hangman") is drawn. The goal is to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn.

## The game typically follows these steps:

- The word-chooser(random) thinks of a word and draws a blank line for each letter in the word. The blanks are usually represented by underscores.

- The guesser suggests a letter.

- If the suggested letter is in the word, the word-chooser fills in all instances of that letter in the blanks.

- If the suggested letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman is drawn. This could be the head, body, arms, legs, etc.

- The game continues with the guess...
